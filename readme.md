## Introduction

**Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?** is the problem's statement and as you can see this problem is [NP-Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness) which we're attempting to solve it using different types of algorithms.

## Algorithms

This repository implements effectively the follwing algorithms:
